        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><a href="/index_mobile.html">go back</a></p>
        <p class="description">I like making new things. I like doing things people haven't tried before, walking places people haven't walked before. This seems very difficult to achieve at first glance, given the thousands of years of people who claimed all the firsts before me. On second glance, however, looking from the top of my dorm's dryer from which I am writing this, I can see the endless loads of work, effort, and time that people have put into creating our built world.</p>
        <p class="description">We often talk about people like Steve Jobs and his team at Apple as THE inventors, but we don't consider the people at Miele who created the washing machine Steve used. We don't often think about Shuji Nakamura and his dedication to creating the blue LED. We overlook the countless laborers, designers, architects, and teachers who made these achievements possible.</p>
        <p class="description">Put into this perspective, it's easier than ever to do something for the first time. Yet the world doesn't gasp when I bend a dining hall fork at 5 p.m. on Wednesday, August 27, at Place Vanier for the first time; they gasp when their clothes come out perfectly washed. That's the kind of first I want to pursue. To make a washing machine, an iPhone, or a blue LED â€” perched not only on the shoulders of giants, but on their dryers too.</p>
